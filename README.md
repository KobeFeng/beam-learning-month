## Webinar 1: An interactive introduction to Apache Beam

In this presentation, Sam Rohde and Ning Kang introduced Apache Beam using Jupyter Notebooks by live coding a batch 
pipeline using publicly available COVID-19 data.

They also had prepared a streaming pipeline, but due to time constraints, they couldn't present it. Nonetheless, they made the code available.
