Welcome to Beam Learning Month's repository! Here, you will find links to the recordings and source files that were used during the presentations. 

If you have feedback on on how to improve Apache Beam and these webinars, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uw3gvhp7gHmrFiPixYoQcpBqnUbjJhABf0KCGsFekn4/edit). We will use your feedback to prepare future webinar content and prioritize feature requests in Apache Beam. 

If you have an interesting use case with Apache Beam and would like to speak at future webinars, please submit your talk to the [Beam Summit 2020](http://beamsummit.org/) or reach out to Apache Beam mailing list at <dev@beam.apache.org> with your talk details. 

We also created a [#beamlearningmonth-05-2020 Slack channel](https://bit.ly/2RO9TmO) if you want to connect to other attendees of the Beam Learning Month and have further discussions on Beam.

## Webinar 1: An interactive introduction to Apache Beam

In this presentation, Sam Rohde and Ning Kang introduced Apache Beam using Jupyter Notebooks by live coding a batch 
pipeline using publicly available COVID-19 data.

They also had prepared a streaming pipeline, but due to time constraints, they couldn't present it. Nonetheless, they made the code available.
